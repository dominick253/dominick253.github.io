    <h2>Welcome to My Home Lab Journey!</h2>
    <hr />
    <br />

    <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      It all started when my old WiFi router started acting up. Annoyed yet
      intrigued by the issue, I decided to dive into the world of network
      hardware and software management to fix the problem. As a programming
      student at the time, I had a 2014 HP laptop with a broken keyboard just
      sitting around. Instead of seeing it as e-waste, I realized its
      potential to be reborn as a network guardian for my home. The first
      step? Installing OpnSense on it - a FreeBSD based open-source software
      that delivers easy-to-use, robust firewall and routing capabilities.
    </p>

      <img id="overlay-image" src="" alt="Fullscreen image" />
    </div>
    <br />

    <h2>Evolving the Home Lab</h2>
    <p>
      After finishing my programming course, I felt the need to deploy a
      website from scratch - to bring into existence what was only theoretical
      knowledge till then. To replace the laptop-as-router setup and optimize
      my home network, I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 B - a small but mighty
      device perfect for this task. Installing OpenWRT on it, I transformed
      this credit-card-sized computer into a fully capable router that could
      handle my network traffic with ease.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="img" id="pi" src="assets/Pi OpenWRT Router - comp2.jpeg" alt="OpenWRT router with a 3d printed case." />

    <h2>The Server-side Story</h2>

    <p>
      With the network issue sorted and the Raspberry Pi working as a router,
      the old laptop got a new lease of life - this time as a server. I
      installed Ubuntu Server on it and set about constructing my website,
      brick by digital brick. However, I soon realized that containerization
      would simplify both development and maintenance, making the transition
      between my development laptop and the server a breeze. Enter Docker and
      Portainer: these tools helped me create and manage my containers
      efficiently, and the difference was night and day!

    <h2>Status - 8-14-23</h2>
    <p>
      Today, my website,
      <a href="https://portfolio.dominickp.com" style="text-decoration: underline">Dominickp.com</a>, stands proudly
      hosted on my home server. But it's not alone.
      Accompanying it is a host of robust applications and services that
      amplify the capabilities of my home lab:

    <h2>Cloudflare Tunnel</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      To overcome the challenge of a dynamic IP address issued by my ISP, I've
      set up a Cloudflare tunnel. This keeps my external connections running
      smoothly, no matter how many times my ISP decides to shuffle the IP
      deck.

  <h2>My Home Lab's New Evolution - 8-21-23</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    So, Iâ€™ve made a few changes since the last update, and I'm excited to
    share them with you. Funny enough, I find myself with another laptop with
    a broken keyboard - this time a 2015 ASUS ROG gaming laptop with a i7
    4720HQ CPU and 24GB ram with a 965M Nvidia graphics card. I wonder if it's
    a sign from the universe that I'm meant to breathe new life into discarded
    tech. ðŸ¤£
  </p>

  <img class="img" src="assets/ASUS-ROG-Server2.jpeg" alt="ASUS ROG gaming laptop running Proxmox" />
  <br />

  <h2>Stepping Up with Proxmox</h2>
  <br />

  <p>
    I finally took the plunge and installed Proxmox on the ASUS ROG. Instead
    of transferring over the old Ubuntu Server, I felt the urge to start
    fresh, giving me the opportunity to refine my setup. A key improvement
    Iâ€™ve made is in the networking realm: Iâ€™ve established a Docker network
    and assigned all my containers static IP addresses. This straightforward
    change made a world of difference in streamlining my setup, especially
    when interfacing with the Cloudflare tunnel. No more constant IP updates
    after every reboot!
  </p>

  <h2>For the Gamers</h2>
  <br />

  <p>
    To add a splash of fun to my home lab, Iâ€™ve spun up servers for "7 Days to
    Die" and "GTA 5". Now, my friends and I have a dedicated playground for
    our gaming sessions. Itâ€™s been a blast hosting these, and itâ€™s just
    another testament to what you can achieve with a home lab.
  </p>

  <h2>Windows in My Home Lab? Yes!</h2>
  <br />

  <p>
    While Iâ€™m a huge fan of open-source platforms, I must admit some
    applications just feel more at home on Windows. So, Iâ€™ve allocated a slice
    of my resources to a Windows 10 VM. Itâ€™s strictly business (okay, maybe a
    little play), serving some applications that either only work on Windows
    or just perform better on it.
  </p>
  <img class="img" src="assets/Proxmox-Windows102.jpeg" alt="Game server dashboard" />

  <h2>The Versatility of VS Code Server</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    VS Code, the popular code editor from Microsoft, isn't just confined to
    desktop environments. Using a linuxserver.io docker container I set up a
    VS Code Server on my Ubuntu server. This has completely revolutionized the
    way I work on projects!
  </p>
  <img class="img" src="assets/Vs-Code-Server2.jpeg" alt="VS Code Server UI on Ubuntu" />
  <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    After countless hours spent manually updating my website on the server,
    I've come to a powerful realization: the importance of CI/CD (Continuous
    Integration/Continuous Deployment) cannot be overstated. Driven by this
    newfound understanding, I decided to leverage my recent experience with
    Ansible to develop a webhook listener specifically for my website's GitHub
    repository.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Here's how the workflow unfolds: Whenever I push changes to the main
    branch of my GitHub repo, it automatically triggers GitHub to send a
    notification to a server hosted on an Ansible LXC container within my
    Proxmox setup. This server then executes an Ansible playbook designed to
    clone the repo, run npm install, and restart the serverâ€”all in a seamless,
    automated fashion.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    What's truly remarkable is Ansible's intelligent decision-making
    capabilities. For instance, it knows not to tamper with the .env file if
    it hasn't been modified in the commit. This feature ensures that only the
    altered files are updated, resulting in far more efficient deployments
    that don't unnecessarily disrupt every component of the website.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The brilliance of incorporating Ansible into my CI workflow has been
    nothing short of a revelation. While the initial setup required some
    legwork, the scalability is astounding. With a simple copy-paste of the
    code, a port number change, and the addition of a new webhook, I can
    effortlessly extend this CI pipeline to as many services as I want.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I can't help but imagine the transformative impact this could have on
    large corporations. They could automate and streamline the management of
    multiple services that are in a state of constant evolution, thereby
    saving countless hours of tedious, manual work. This is automation at its
    finest, and I'm thrilled to be harnessing its power.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2>Proxmox and Raspberry Pi Clusters</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    Are you as captivated by clustering as I am? If so, you'll be excited to
    hear about my latest project: setting up additional Proxmox nodes to
    achieve high availability (HA). I've had my fair share of experience with
    Kubernetes clusters, but they've been confined to virtual machinesâ€”until
    now.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Taking inspiration from tech wizard Jeff Geerling, I've started exploring
    the possibility of building a Raspberry Pi 4B cluster. While these nifty
    devices aren't widely available just yet, the situation is improving
    steadily. Soon, I hope to create a tangible, real-world cluster that
    brings my networking dreams to life!
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Now, you might wonder, why not virtualize my router using Proxmox and
    repurpose my existing Raspberry Pi 4B router into another Proxmox node? It
    sounds like a fantastic idea, but here's the catch: if my internet
    connection fails for even a moment, I risk sparking a household mutiny!
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So, as you can see, the journey toward clustering and high availability is
    full of thrills and challenges. Stick around as I continue to share
    updates on these exciting endeavors!
  </p>

  <h2>Latest Update - 11-15-2023</h2>
  <p>
    Exciting news in my homelab journey: I've set up a Proxmox cluster with two nodes, complemented by a Raspberry Pi 5
    acting as a Q device for quorum. However, my trusty red 2014 HP laptop is showing its age, as the latest Proxmox
    updates no longer support its USB for external drives and Ethernet adapters. I'm contemplating whether to keep
    running the older Proxmox version or repurpose the laptop for another project like TrueNAS or Open Media Vault.
    Meanwhile, my Proxmox cluster, hosting 3 Kubernetes nodes, ensures double high availability. This setup has been a
    great learning experience, demonstrating how major corporations maintain uninterrupted online services.
