      <h2>Welcome to My Home Lab Journey!</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />

      <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        It all started when my old WiFi router started acting up. Annoyed yet
        intrigued by the issue, I decided to dive into the world of network
        hardware and software management to fix the problem. As a programming
        student at the time, I had a 2014 HP laptop with a broken keyboard just
        sitting around. Instead of seeing it as e-waste, I realized its
        potential to be reborn as a network guardian for my home. The first
        step? Installing OpnSense on it - a FreeBSD based open-source software
        that delivers easy-to-use, robust firewall and routing capabilities.
      </p>

      />
      <div id="overlay" style="display: none">

        <img id="overlay-image" src="" alt="Fullscreen image" />
      </div>
      <br />

      <h2>Evolving the Home Lab</h2>
      <p>
        After finishing my programming course, I felt the need to deploy a
        website from scratch - to bring into existence what was only theoretical
        knowledge till then. To replace the laptop-as-router setup and optimize
        my home network, I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 B - a small but mighty
        device perfect for this task. Installing OpenWRT on it, I transformed
        this credit-card-sized computer into a fully capable router that could
        handle my network traffic with ease.
      </p>
      <br />

        alt="OpenWRT router with a 3d printed case."
      />

      <h2>The Server-side Story</h2>

      <p>
        With the network issue sorted and the Raspberry Pi working as a router,
        the old laptop got a new lease of life - this time as a server. I
        installed Ubuntu Server on it and set about constructing my website,
        brick by digital brick. However, I soon realized that containerization
        would simplify both development and maintenance, making the transition
        between my development laptop and the server a breeze. Enter Docker and
        Portainer: these tools helped me create and manage my containers
        efficiently, and the difference was night and day!
      </p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
      <p>
        Today, my website,
        <a href="https://dominickp.com" style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Dominickp.com</a
        >, stands proudly hosted on my home server. But it's not alone.
        Accompanying it is a host of robust applications and services that
        amplify the capabilities of my home lab:

      <h2>Cloudflare Tunnel</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        To overcome the challenge of a dynamic IP address issued by my ISP, I've
        set up a Cloudflare tunnel. This keeps my external connections running
        smoothly, no matter how many times my ISP decides to shuffle the IP
        deck.
      </p>
    </main>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Looking towards the future, I'm considering dipping my toes into the realm
      of hypervisors. Proxmox is on my radar, although a pesky system clock
      error on the laptop has been causing some initial hiccups. Perhaps a
      simple fix like replacing the clock battery will resolve the issue and
      open the doors to this next chapter. Stay tuned as I continue my home lab
      journey, learning, growing, and sharing my knowledge along the way. From a
      broken router to hosting my own website and services, it's been an
      exciting adventure - and this is just the beginning! Want to embark on
      your own home lab adventure? Feel free to explore the resources on this

    <h2>My Home Lab's New Evolution</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      So, Iâ€™ve made a few changes since the last update, and I'm excited to
      share them with you. Funny enough, I find myself with another laptop with
      a broken keyboard - this time a 2015 ASUS ROG gaming laptop with a i7
      4720HQ CPU and 24GB ram with a 965M Nvidia graphics card. I wonder if it's
      a sign from the universe that I'm meant to breathe new life into discarded
      tech. ðŸ¤£
    </p>

      alt="ASUS ROG gaming laptop running Proxmox"
    />
    <br />

    <h2>Stepping Up with Proxmox</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      I finally took the plunge and installed Proxmox on the ASUS ROG. Instead
      of transferring over the old Ubuntu Server, I felt the urge to start
      fresh, giving me the opportunity to refine my setup. A key improvement
      Iâ€™ve made is in the networking realm: Iâ€™ve established a Docker network
      and assigned all my containers static IP addresses. This straightforward
      change made a world of difference in streamlining my setup, especially
      when interfacing with the Cloudflare tunnel. No more constant IP updates
      after every reboot!
    </p>

      src="assets/Proxmox-Home-Screen2.jpeg"
      alt="Proxmox home screen"
    />
    <h2>For the Gamers</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      To add a splash of fun to my home lab, Iâ€™ve spun up servers for "7 Days to
      Die" and "GTA 5". Now, my friends and I have a dedicated playground for
      our gaming sessions. Itâ€™s been a blast hosting these, and itâ€™s just
      another testament to what you can achieve with a home lab.
    </p>
    <img
      class="img"
      src="assets/Proxmox-7days-server2.jpeg"
      alt="Game server dashboard"
    />

    <h2>Windows in My Home Lab? Yes!</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      While Iâ€™m a huge fan of open-source platforms, I must admit some
      applications just feel more at home on Windows. So, Iâ€™ve allocated a slice
      of my resources to a Windows 10 VM. Itâ€™s strictly business (okay, maybe a
      little play), serving some applications that either only work on Windows
      or just perform better on it.
    </p>
    <img
      class="img"
      src="assets/Proxmox-Windows102.jpeg"
      alt="Game server dashboard"
    />

    <h2>Security & Accessibility</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      With my expanding suite of services and tools, secure yet convenient
      remote access became a necessity. I'm currently in the process of setting
      up a WireGuard VPN. This way, accessing my home network and all its
      offerings will be seamless and secure, even when Iâ€™m miles away.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>The Versatility of VS Code Server</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      VS Code, the popular code editor from Microsoft, isn't just confined to
      desktop environments. Using a linuxserver.io docker container I set up a
      VS Code Server on my Ubuntu server. This has completely revolutionized the
      way I work on projects!
    </p>
    <img
      class="img"
      src="assets/Vs-Code-Server2.jpeg"
      alt="VS Code Server UI on Ubuntu"
    />

    <h2>By setting up VS Code Server, I've gained several advantages:</h2>
    <br />
    <ol class="centered-list">
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Power Consumption:</strong> <br />Running intensive tasks on a
        server rather than a laptop means significant savings in battery life,
        especially when on the go.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Performance:</strong><br />
        My Ubuntu server, being more powerful than many standard laptops or
        mobile devices, can handle heavier workloads, compile tasks, or run
        resource-intensive applications effortlessly.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Consistency:</strong> <br />No matter which device I connect
        from, be it a high-end workstation or a modest mobile device, I have a
        consistent development environment ready and waiting.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Accessibility:</strong><br />
        All I need is an Internet connection, and I can continue my work from
        anywhere in the world, accessing all my tools, extensions, and
        configurations exactly how I left them.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      This setup has essentially given me a portable, high-powered, and
      consistent development environment without being tethered to any specific
      hardware. Now, even if I'm armed just with a tablet or a lightweight
      laptop, I can tap into the full power of my home server, code as if I'm on
      a powerful workstation, and save my device's resources for other tasks.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      With the combination of the Ubuntu server's reliability and VS Code's
      flexibility, my development workflow is smoother, faster, and more
      versatile than ever. If you're looking to break the confines of
      traditional development environments, I'd highly recommend giving VS Code
      Server a shot!
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      The adventure deepens. Next on my list? Channeling the power of the 965M
      GPU into my Windows 10 VM for some Parsec remote gaming. While the 965M
      may not be the titan of graphics, it packs enough punch to handle most
      contemporary gamesâ€”even if at more modest settings. Compared to my main
      laptop's AMD 5500u, the 965M stands out as a gaming powerhouse, promising
      not just enhanced performance but also a significant boost in battery
      life.
      <br />
      <br />
