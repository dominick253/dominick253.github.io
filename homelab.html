        <h2>Welcome to My Home Lab Journey!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>My Origin Story</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            It all started when my old WiFi router started playing up. Annoyed yet intrigued by the issue, I decided to
            dive into the world of network hardware and software management to fix the problem. As a programming student
            at the time, I had a 2014 HP laptop with a broken keyboard just sitting around. Instead of seeing it as
            e-waste, I realized its potential to be reborn as a network guardian for my home.

            The first step? Installing OpnSense on it - a FreeBSD based open-source software that delivers easy-to-use,
            robust firewall and routing capabilities.

        <h3>Evolving the Home Lab</h3>
        <p>
            After finishing my programming course, I felt the need to deploy a website from scratch - to bring into
            existence what was only theoretical knowledge till then. To replace the laptop-as-router setup and optimize
            my home network, I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 B - a small but mighty device perfect for this task.

            Installing OpenWRT on it, I transformed this credit-card-sized computer into a fully capable router that
            could handle my network traffic with ease.

    <h3>The Server-side Story</h3>

    <p>With the network issue sorted and the Raspberry Pi working as a router, the old laptop got a new lease of life -
        this time as a server. I installed Ubuntu Server on it and set about constructing my website, brick by digital
        brick.

        However, I soon realized that containerization would simplify both development and maintenance, making the
        transition between my development laptop and the server a breeze. Enter Docker and Portainer: these tools helped
        me create and manage my containers efficiently, and the difference was night and day!</p>

    <h3>Current Status</h3>
    <p>Today, my website, <a href="https://dominickp.com" style="text-decoration:underline;">Dominickp.com</a>, stands proudly hosted on my home server.
        But it's not alone. Accompanying it is a host of robust applications and services that amplify the capabilities
        of my home lab:</p>

    <ol class="centered-list">
        <li><strong>Uptime Kuma:</strong> A beautiful, self-hosted monitoring tool that helps me keep track of my
            server's health and performance.</li>
            <img class="img" src="assets/Uptime Kuma - comp.png" alt="Uptime Kuma">

        <br>
        <li><strong>Jellyfin:</strong> This open-source media system is my go-to for organizing and streaming my
            multimedia content.</li>
            <img class="img" src="assets/Jellyfin - comp.png" alt="Jellyfin">

        <br>

        <li><strong>Nextcloud:</strong> File sharing is a breeze with Nextcloud. It offers a safe, private, and
            convenient solution for syncing and sharing my files.</li>
            <img class="img" src="assets/Nextcloud - comp.png" alt="Nextcloud">

        <br>

        <li><strong>Heimdall Application Dashboard:</strong> This elegant solution helps me keep all my applications
            organized under one roof. It acts as a homepage for all the apps running on my server, making access quick
            and straightforward.</li>
            <img class="img" src="assets/Heimdall - comp.png" alt="Heimdall">

        <br>

        <li><strong>CasaOS:</strong> A relatively new player in my lab, CasaOS simplifies my home cloud and smart home
            experience. It's an innovative IoT (Internet of Things) home server OS that provides a unified platform for
            smart home management.</li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Portainer:</strong> This powerful open-source tool allows me to manage my Docker environments with
            ease, making containerization an effortless endeavor.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>To overcome the challenge of a dynamic IP address issued by my ISP, I've set up a Cloudflare tunnel. This keeps
        my external connections running smoothly, no matter how many times my ISP decides to shuffle the IP deck.</p>


    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
    <p>Looking towards the future, I'm considering dipping my toes into the realm of hypervisors. Proxmox is on my
        radar, although a pesky system clock error on the laptop has been causing some initial hiccups. Perhaps a simple
        fix like replacing the clock battery will resolve the issue and open the doors to this next chapter.

        Stay tuned as I continue my home lab journey, learning, growing, and sharing my knowledge along the way. From a
        broken router to hosting my own website and services, it's been an exciting adventure - and this is just the
        beginning!
